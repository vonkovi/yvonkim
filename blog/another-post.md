# Why I Left Big Tech to Build My Own Thing

After five years at one of the world's largest tech companies, I made a decision that surprised everyone, including myself: I quit to start my own company.

## The Golden Handcuffs

Big tech companies are incredibly good at making you comfortable. The salary, the benefits, the prestige – it all creates a lifestyle that's hard to walk away from.

But comfort can be a trap.

## The Turning Point

It wasn't a single moment, but rather a gradual realization that I was optimizing for the wrong metrics. I was climbing someone else's ladder, working on problems that didn't excite me, building solutions that enriched shareholders rather than users.

## The Leap

Leaving wasn't easy. There were sleepless nights, financial concerns, and moments of doubt. But there was also something I hadn't felt in years: excitement about the future.

## What I've Learned

Building your own thing teaches you lessons that no corporate job can:

- **Resourcefulness**: When you can't throw money at problems, you get creative
- **Focus**: Everything you do has direct consequences
- **Resilience**: Failure isn't just a learning opportunity – it's an existential threat

## The Reality Check

Entrepreneurship isn't for everyone. It's stressful, uncertain, and often lonely. But for those who feel called to create something from nothing, it might be the only path that leads to true fulfillment.

## Moving Forward

I don't regret my time in big tech. It taught me valuable skills and gave me the financial cushion to take risks. But I'm grateful I had the courage to leave when I did.

Sometimes the biggest risk is not taking any risk at all.
