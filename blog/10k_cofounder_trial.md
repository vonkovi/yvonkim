The common advice that YC gives to founders is to find a cofounder that you have known personally for 2+ years. YC also preaches that you should aim for someone that reminds of James Bond, a chariature of a relentlessly resourceful individual. And when you find this individual, perhaps it is best to go through a trial period to see if it's a match. These are exceptional advice for aspiring to enter the startup world. 

However, during this trial period, YC simply states to try out a project. While the purpose of the message is to help founders get a feel for potential cofounders, I find this advice vague and quite lacking in insight. The first time I heard this, I immediately thought about a hackathon project somewhat relevant to the startup. We scrapped up a prototype and won the hackathon. But months later, we grew distant and the relationship grew dull. 

Looking back, our cofounder relationship was bound to fail. There were communication errors, lack of passion, and we weren't close.

But if the relationship were bound to fall through, we should have failed during the trial period! We misinterpreted the advice and put a lame metric to determine our strength as a team. Instead, we wasted 3 months ultimately achieving nothing.

So what makes an effective trial period? Try out the 10K cofounder trial.

You have one week to make $10,000.

The trial is quite elegant where the objective is stupid simple, yet require exceptional teamwork to pull off. It tests the team's ability to maintain frequent communication, tests the adapatibility of high-pressure situations, and forces everybody to get scrappy.

The trial is demanding and often results in failing cases. Personally, I have had seven failing cases with zero success cases. (Note: It may seem overly brutal, but the mindset I like to think is that I saved 21 months of meaningless work). But I have shared this advice and my observation shows that those who manage to survive the trial went on to multimillion dollar ventures. 

Finally, it is flexible enough that it doesn't shoehorn you. There are countless ways to earn $10K, and cofounders implicitly discover that if the original idea didn't work out, it is best to move onto a new idea as soon as possible. It hones the traits of startup founders aiming for hypergrowth startups.

While I have great willingness to share this advice, I have some warnings. This trial experiment is not deeply explored. The dataset of people using this trial is relatively small, and my observations stems from less than 50 cases. While I like to believe that the conclusion can be converged onto quickly, it's not a definite reason to exempt the fact that everything is untrue.

You don't have to meet the $10,000 bar to determine if you want to work with someone. Say you managed scrape up half the amount; does this mean you shouldn't be cofounders? The problem with the trial is that there are more false positives. It is surprisingly constrained and can fail cofounders who are actually destined to succeed. 

Finally, the trial is optimized for startups aiming for hypergrowth. If you aren't aiming for hypergrowth, maybe this trial is quite unecessary! 


All the best,
