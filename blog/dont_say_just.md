A couple months back, I was working with my (not-so-favorite) coworker. He and I started working together to build this automation tool that would save the company thousands of hours. Because the tool was complex and coding-intensive, having him working on this filled me with initial optimism. He was very knowledgable and brilliant. Unfortunately, he was also an arrogant prick.

Our first day in, as we were deciding on a list of users to validate our idea, I suggested with a list of questions to ask neighboring teams. We agreed, and I came up with 7-8 questions. I believed that the questions were sound: focused on user's pain points, frequency of the problem, and identifying user's prerequisite for trust. I tidied up and showed him the questions and even coded a demo.

But yea, he shot down every question. His favorite word was "just."

His argument were better than mine: make questions shorter, simplify areas, and don't show the product yet. From a project standpoint, it was effective and concise. And when you take everything into account, my efforts really don't hold up. After all, you don't need seven questions when you just need two.

But I couldn't stand how he presented his arguments; it wasn't right. I didn't like being placed underneath him. Nor did I like having this new feeling of catching up. To me, I soured because I had felt that he took any opportunities to lift himself up.

Though by distaste remained, I waved it off because I knew I was stuck with him for the next week or so. I just took mental note to limit unnecessary interactions and focus the project.

I always knew the lessons on humility and arrogance, but this incident was a stark reminder to myself (and hopefully others) to never hold your chin too high. Next time, when a janitor waves at you, wave back. Next time, when an opportunity to defeat an enemy arises, give an olive branch. Next time, when you urge to take the moral pedestal, stay on the flat.
