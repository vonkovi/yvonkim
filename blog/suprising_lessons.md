Often I thought I'd figured everything out, only to be humbled time and time again. Usually, they appear in surprises. These surprises, are often kernels to truth and growth. And growth isn't about making the right decisions, rather it's about reflecting on these moments in shame. Here are my three cents learnt in shame:

- Pay attention to surprising emotions. When my emotions appear contrasts to what I expected, it's worth taking a look inside and acknowledging the real truth. 
- Don't play big moralizer. I learned that there is a fine line between having character and big moralizers; one focuses internally while the other is about image and projection.
- Combat fear of intimacy. I find this an uncomfortable lesson because I really struggled with this one and still do. But it stunts relationships more than I could ever know.

The list could go on longer, but then I'd be writing for 3 more hours. Hot dog.
